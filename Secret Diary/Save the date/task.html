<p>In the second stage, add two more functionalities to your application. First, the diary should save all the notes, not only the last one. Also, a user may want to see when each note is created, so you need to attach the date and time when a message was added.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ul>
<li>Change the functionality of the <code class="java">Save</code> button. When a user clicks on it, append a new note to the top of the diary with the timestamp, which is the date and time of creation</li>
<li>The timestamp come first with the following format: <code class="java">yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss</code>. The saved text should appear in the following line</li>
<li>To produce the timestamp use <code class="java">SimpleDateFormat</code> with <code class="java">Locale.getDefault()</code> so that the timestamp produced is aware of user's timezone while being produced</li>
<li>Separate each note with an empty line</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Obs: The passage of time will be emulated on tests.
  There are several time related apis in java/kotlin/android environment,
  but tests time emulation won't guarantee to be compatible with all of them for this project.
</p>
<p>
  You can use <code class="java">Clock.System.now()</code>
  which will be guaranteed to be compatible with tests time emulation.
